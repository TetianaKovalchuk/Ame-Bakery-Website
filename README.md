# Ame-Bakery-Website
A website of a bakery.
I fully designed it myself. This website contained many things that were new to me. One of them is the "product filters" that filter stuff by price and categories. I used JS, ECMAScript, and jQuery for that. Also, that's one of my first experiences with multiple-page websites. The website's theme and name were randomly generated for practice, so this isn't a real bakery. The link attached is a GitHub Pages link, and it doesn't show the scripts and some of the assets, so please watch the presentation video attached.
